# Image Search App

This project is an image search web application that fetches images from the Unsplash API based on user input. It was built to enhance my knowledge of JavaScript, API integration, and asynchronous programming.

## Features

- Search for Images: Users can search for images by entering keywords.
- Load More Results: Users can load more results by clicking the "Show More" button.
- Responsive Design: Ensures the application looks great on all devices.
- Interactive UI: Displays search results dynamically without reloading the page.
